# Going Off the Rails: Infrastructure Outage Planning

background on problems at kings cross.

network rail post mortem, official gov report

"squirrel point" - squirrel in middle of road, can stop until you get to a point

insufficient contingency in plan

no rollback planned

problem happened on boxing day - analogous to doing maintenance in middle of
night, when rest of company is not around.

outage picked at low point of traffic, but because overrunning traffic is
picking up and it becomes a busy time again.

keeping lines of communication open during outage really important

staff get tired - in train outage it is legislated for. critical internet
infrastructure can just drink more red bull and stay up...
