# post ops revisited

Did we get to somewhere after operations?

Ops / sysadmin dead. Devops a bandaid

stop doing machines work for them

no NOC - make computers do that

SRE -

	Keep service up - whatever it takes

	work at large scale (not people)

	balance competing demands


dont treat software as a black box

linux on vms is the new platform - a level of abstraction

vms not so great
  heavyweight, slow

alternative - jobs / tasks - borg / mesos

likely compromise - containers, with scheduler (kubernetes, docker shipyard, ec2
container service)

storage

 - not decided what to demand
 - block storage / object storgage
 - semi structured storage (hbase, cassandra, redis, couchdb)


automated everything - builds, canarying

production is not development - dev environments need to be closer

industry moves fast
we are moving towards being sres everywhere, but not done yet
