# Continuous Improvement Using Comprehensive Root Cause Analysis

Talking about "super" computers for scientific computation

scheduling policy encourages large long jobs

app requirements are different - low latency networks

tools built to provide better reports / access to metrics

split into hardware and os failures

more accurate results, because granularity was 1 week

due to reporting, level of knowledge increased.

deploy a team to look at specific problem and fix it

big improvments by investigating the root cause

very valuable, but 4 - 5 hours long! painful

storm project for job failure analysis
