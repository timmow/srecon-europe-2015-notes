# Heraclitus Wears Prada: DevOps, SRE, and Organisational Activities

incentives - structure and derive long term behaviour

sre model (ben trainer?) works because it breaks the organisation incentive
structure that engineer / sysadmin split has

iol isp - callout fee £100 - incentivised not to fix root cause

timesheets

£x per headcount creates incentive to grow for no reason

coarse metrics

sres have parity with swe - shouldnt look down on each other. org should treat
an SRE the same as product engineer

sres should be able to move - operational disaster. really bad products,
operational responsibility should be handed back to devs.

if product slips below a notional threshold for success, development team must
help with moving it back up

demand for sre is high.

"error budgets" 1 - 0.9999 - allowed to be 0.0001 unavailable - can use allowed
unreliability to do risky things

what can you do to offset things if you cant do this?

no parity - 
	makes every other change more difficult
	transfer between groups - devs do sre work, sre do dev work
	or start a new group with explicitly different charter.
	explicitly demonstrate competence
	standard managerial actions
	joint codathons, joint training
	tighter feedback loop

moving around
	too small - less ability to move around
	is sre applicable for small companies?
	can you move around between sub components?
	sre people as part of dev teams
