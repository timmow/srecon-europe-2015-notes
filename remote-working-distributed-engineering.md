things to think of as remote engineer

comms

   irc - but takes longer than sitting next to people
   
   1:1s - at least 2 - 3 times a week

discipline

   difficult when new, get distracted
   keep working on, easy to slip
   schedule in calendar
   keep work area tidy
   collobarate, lead projects, dont accept work silently

balance

   start / end times of day
   take a vacation
   get a hobby

conflict resolution

  25% of managers time
  critical for remote engineers

managers
  regular 1:1s
  encourage remote by default
  core hours for availability
  do encourage, dont micro manage
  hire comms and doers
  budget for travel / good equipment
  pair people in different regions
  doubles development - people in different groups, paired up
  video conferencing for pairing
  find out how employees feeling
  do they need your help
  invest in good A/V solution
  advocate for remotes who arent present
  moderate meetings - remotes need a voice
  dont just have one remote engineer!
